# SHELTER - A Strategic Survival Card Game (Mobile Adaptation)
A React Native adaptation of a social strategy game where players compete to prove their randomly-assigned character (with traits like age, profession, and skills) would be most valuable in a survival bunker scenario.

### Why I Built This  
My first iOS app started as an experiment to:
- Learn mobile development with React Native/Expo
- Create a party game my friends could actually play
- Explore full-stack possibilities (initially prototyped with Node.js APIs)

Ultimately shipped as a polished offline experience when I realized client-side state worked better for this casual game.

### Key Features
- Dynamic card-based gameplay with tap animations
- Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
- Local multiplayer ready (no internet required)
- Thematic UI with clean, readable design

### Tech Stack
- **React Native**: Built the entire UI with animations, touch interactions, and offline-ready state management (hooks). 
- **Expo**: Used Expo’s tools to simplify builds and avoid native code—shipping a pure-JavaScript app. 
- **Node.js**: Early API prototyping (later removed for offline play)
