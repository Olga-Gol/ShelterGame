### In this game, you receive a random set of cards that determine your gender, age, profession, and other traits, and your task is to convince the others that this set of characteristics will be very useful for survival in the bunker.
SHELTER, my first venture into iOS app development, served as a comprehensive exercise in leveraging the React Native framework, coupled with the extensive capabilities of the Expo
ecosystem. This project marked my entry into the world of mobile app development and was a gaming experience custom-made for my friends.

## Technical Proficiencies Gained:
• **React Native Framework**: Mastered the essentials of React Native to create a seamless, native-like user experience for iOS. Delved into React's component-based architecture, enabling the rapid development of a dynamic and responsive user interface that feels at home on iOS devices.

• **Expo Ecosystem Integration**: Utilized Expo to streamline the development process, from initial setup to deployment. Gained proficiency in using Expo's managed workflow, which significantly reduced the complexity of native code configuration, allowing for a focus on pure JavaScript development.

• **Interactive and Responsive Design**: Crafted a user interface that is both interactive and responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and orientations. This was achieved through styling and layout design, ensuring a consistent and engaging user experience. 

• **React Navigation and Core Components**: Mastered the use of React Navigation to implement a multi-layered navigation structure within the app. Demonstrated proficiency in React Native's foundational components to build a responsive and aesthetically pleasing interface.
